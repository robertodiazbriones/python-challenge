# Python-challenge
Hello this is the **Python Challenge** homework that corresponds to the 3rd unit of the _Data Analisis bootcamp course_, on this homework we were assign to analize 2 sets of data **PyBank.csv** and **PyPoll.csv** using python scripting with the csv library. 

## PyBank.csv
From this file we have to get the next data.  
-The total number of months included in the dataset.  
-The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.  
-Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes.  
-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.  
-The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.  
-The final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.   

## PyPoll.csv
From this file we have to get the next data.  
-The total number of votes cast.  
-A complete list of candidates who received votes.  
-The percentage of votes each candidate won.  
-The total number of votes each candidate won.
-The winner of the election based on popular vote.  
-The final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## What I learnt

On this homework had the chance to interact with the buitl-in _csv_ library and get to know how to use the _**reader**_ method, I tried to keep my solution as simple as posible using conditionals, loops, lists and dictionaries. I think my solution is simple, easy to understand and the best is that it works :raised_hands:.   

Besides practice with python scripting more, on this homework I challenged myself to get a full understanding of how to commit changes of my project on github thru gitbash and use the _markdown sintaxis_ to edit the readme on git hub :blush: and as it can be seen how to insert emojis :laughing:.
